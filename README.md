IPL Pinch Hitters in PowerPlay – Data Analysis
📌 Overview
This project analyzes the best pinch hitters in the PowerPlay (PP) overs of the IPL using the latest available data. A pinch hitter is a batter who accelerates the scoring rate early in the innings, often taking aggressive risks.

🎯 Objective
Identify the most effective pinch hitters in PowerPlay (minimum 20 innings)
Analyze key batting metrics such as Strike Rate (SR), Balls Per Boundary (BPB), and Score Efficiency
Compare performances of different batters to determine the top PowerPlay aggressors
📊 Key Findings
Travis Head leads with an SR of 195.26, proving to be the most explosive batter in PowerPlay
Sunil Narine (58 innings, SR 163.95) plays a high-impact role similar to Andre Russell
Abhishek Sharma and YBK Jaiswal have strong boundary-hitting abilities with low BPB values
Jonny Bairstow provides a balanced approach, with stability and aggression combined
